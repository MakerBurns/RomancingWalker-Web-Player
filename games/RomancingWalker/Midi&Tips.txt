Sound Issues: Midis sound different with your multimedia settings
              Goto Control Panel and choose Multimedia Settings, then
              look at the MIDI device setting, if your setting is                    "Microsoft GS Wave Table SW", then no problem. But if
              your setting is either soudblaster (sb16) or others the
              midis sound very crappy compare to window default                    settings! So please be noted.
